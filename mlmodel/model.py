DRDO's pursuit of self-reliance and successful indigenous development andproduction of strategic systems and platforms such as Agni and Prithvi series of missiles; light combat aircraft, Tejas; multi-barrel rocket launcher,Pinaka; air defence system, Akash; a wide range of radars and electronic warfare systems; etc., have given quantum jump to India's military might,generating effective deterrence and providing crucial leverage.'Balasya Mulam Vigyanam'â€”the source of strength is science-drives the nation in peace andwar. DRDO has firm determination to make the nation strong and self-reliant in terms of science and technology, especially in the field of militarytechnologies.DRDO was formed in 1958 from the amalgamation of the then already functioning Technical Development Establishment (TDEs) of the Indian Armyand the Directorate of Technical Development & Production (DTDP) with the Defence Science Organisation (DSO). DRDO was then a small organisation with 10establishments or laboratories. Over the years, it has grown multi-directionally in terms of the variety of subject disciplines, number of laboratories,achievements and stature.Today, DRDO is a network of around 41 laboratories and 05 DRDO Young Scientist Laboratories (DYSLs) which are deeply engaged indeveloping defence technologies covering various disciplines, like aeronautics, armaments, electronics, combat vehicles, engineering systems,instrumentation, missiles, advanced computing and simulation, special materials, naval systems, life sciences, training, information systems andagriculture. Several major projects for the development of missiles, armaments, light combat aircrafts, radars, electronic warfare systems etc are onhand and significant achievements have already been made in several such technologies."
