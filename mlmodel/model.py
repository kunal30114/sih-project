DRDO was then a small organisation with 10establishments or laboratories. Over the years, it has grown multi-directionally in terms of the variety of subject disciplines, number of laboratories,achievements and stature.Today, DRDO is a network of around 41 laboratories and 05 DRDO Young Scientist Laboratories (DYSLs) which are deeply engaged indeveloping defence technologies covering various disciplines, like aeronautics, armaments, electronics, combat vehicles, engineering systems,instrumentation, missiles, advanced computing and simulation, special materials, naval systems, life sciences, training, information systems andagriculture. Several major projects for the development of missiles, armaments, light combat aircrafts, radars, electronic warfare systems etc are onhand and significant achievements have already been made in several such technologies."
